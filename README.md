# PHP Coding Challenge: Build Your Own Version of `wc`

This challenge is to build a PHP version of the Unix command line tool `wc` (word count). The goal is to replicate the functionality of `wc`, which counts lines, words, and bytes in text input from files or streams.

## Challenge Objective

Replicate the functionality of the `wc` command-line tool by building a PHP program that:

- Accepts input either from files or standard input (stdin).
- Outputs the number of lines, words, and bytes (just like the Unix `wc` tool).

## Unix Philosophy Inspiration

This challenge encourages following the **Unix Philosophy**:

- **Write simple parts, connected by clean interfaces**: Each tool should do one thing well and be easy to use with other tools.
- **Design programs to be connected**: Your `wc` tool should be easily integrated with other programs, forming part of a larger system for processing data.

The Unix command line tools are widely used because they embody these principles, enabling the creation of complex workflows from simple, reusable components.
